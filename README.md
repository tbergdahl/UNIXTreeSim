# UNIXTreeSim
This repo contains code from an assignment for my Systems Programming class at WSU.
This specific assignment was to develop a C program that could simulate a UNIX file tree. I am proud of this project because a lot of work went into this simulator, and I was one of the few students that finished on time.
